#The method .title() causes the string to be displayed in title script ie: first letter of each world capital and the rest lower case.


name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())
print (name)

#Some other methods for case

print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())

""The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. Many times
you won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll
convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to
display the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense for
each string.""
